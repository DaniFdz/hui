/**
 * Development stage of a session, shown as the Kanban column. HUI owns the
 * stage; PI never sees it. The board's first column, Backlog, holds backlog
 * items (Jira work items and local tasks, see `backlog.ts`), never sessions:
 * a session always sits in one of the work stages, Investigation first.
 *
 * The operator, the session's own agent (through the `set_stage` tool) and the
 * session's pull requests can each move it, with a fixed precedence: an operator placement wins until the operator clears it,
 * and pull-request evidence only ever advances an agent-reported stage.
