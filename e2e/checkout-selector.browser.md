# Checkout and worktree selector

Verified on 2026-09-24 with the OpenClaw Browser tool against the running HUI
app.

## Environment

- Disposable Git repository with `main` and `topic` branches under `/tmp`.
- Isolated `XDG_CONFIG_HOME`; no operator HUI registry or PI transcript was read
  or changed.
- Vite gateway at `http://localhost:5173/`.
- Desktop viewport: 1440 x 900. Mobile viewport: 390 x 844.

## Journey

1. Open New Session and enter the disposable repository as the project
   directory.
2. Observe the checkout trigger resolve to the repository's current `main`
   branch.
3. Open the Checkout popover and select **New worktree**.
4. Observe the trigger change to **New worktree from main**, the `From` field
   offer discovered refs with HUI-owned menu rows instead of the browser's
   native datalist dropdown, keep the repository default branch first, and the
   optional `Name` field explain that the session title supplies its default.
   Selecting a branch writes it into `From` and closes the branch suggestion
   list while keeping the checkout popover open.
5. Return to **Current checkout**, choose `topic` from the same `From`
   suggestions, and verify the selector stays in Current checkout mode, the
   worktree `Name` field remains hidden, and the branch suggestion list closes.
6. Use **Configure default prefix** to open `/settings/sessions`, where the
   `branchPrefix` input is owned by the same HUI Settings surface.
7. Inspect the rendered popover at desktop and mobile widths. The mobile popup
   repositions above its trigger, remains fully visible and introduces no
   horizontal document overflow.

The server-side integration test separately creates a real worktree from an
explicit non-current base ref and verifies the selected commit is checked out.
The Browser journey intentionally stops before submission so it does not start
PI or create a transcript.

No page runtime errors were observed. The prefix Settings follow-up used a
temporary Brave/CDP profile after the shared browser profile reported
attach-only and unavailable. The first shared browser process was
closed by a concurrent HUI run between viewports; the mobile pass was repeated
from a fresh disposable Brave profile attached to the configured CDP port.
