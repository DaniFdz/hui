# macOS power settings browser verification

Verified on 2026-09-29 with HUI's Browser tool on macOS against an isolated
instance from `node e2e/visual-verification.mjs launch` (fresh HUI/PI state,
deterministic provider, Vite gateway). No operator settings, sessions or
transcripts were read or changed. The host Mac already had `SleepDisabled 1`.

## Reproduce

1. Launch and `doctor` as in the visual verification skill; open the receipt
   URL, then Home → Settings → Gateway at 1440×900 and 390×844.
2. Operate the switches with the keyboard (focus, Space). Pointer clicks land on
   Web Awesome's inner `span.switch`, which the Browser tool reports as covering.
3. Inspect helper processes with `pgrep -fl "caffeinate -i -w"` and the Mac's
   state with `pmset -g | grep SleepDisabled`.

## Observed

- **Power** appears after Runtime with both rows, the elevated-permission note
  on the lid row and a status pill beside each switch.
- Fresh state: Keep Mac awake on and **Active**; `caffeinate -i -w <server pid>`
  was running. Turning it off showed **Off**, persisted `keepAwake: false` and
  the process exited; turning it on started a new one and showed **Active**.
- Stay awake with the lid closed: turning it on showed **Active** with "Already
  on for this Mac outside HUI, so HUI leaves it unchanged." No `osascript`
  prompt ran and no flag directory was created. Turning it off showed **Off**
  with "Still on for this Mac outside HUI." and `SleepDisabled` stayed `1`.
- With lid-close off at startup, the row showed **Off** with "Still on for this
  Mac outside HUI." rather than a bare Off.
- Stopping the instance (`cleanup`) ended its `caffeinate` child.
- Mobile: rows stack; the status pill and switch are vertically aligned and
  no horizontal overflow is visible. Keyboard focus ring is visible on the switch.
- Console: only Lit development-mode warnings.

## Real administrator prompt (2026-09-29, commit 8402bbc)

The operator first ran `sudo pmset -a disablesleep 0`, then on a fresh isolated
instance the lid switch was operated from the Gateway page:

- Turning it on opened the real macOS password dialog (`osascript … with
  administrator privileges`); the row showed **Pending** with "Waiting for
  administrator approval on this Mac."
- The first attempt ended without approval (the operator's password failed):
  the row showed **Failed** with "Administrator approval was cancelled.",
  `SleepDisabled` stayed `0` and no watcher was left.
- Off, then on again, opened a fresh dialog. After approval `pmset -g` showed
  `SleepDisabled 1`, a root `/bin/sh` watcher for the gateway PID was running,
  the flag `lid-awake-<gateway pid>-<uuid>` existed and the row showed
  **Active** with no outside-HUI note.
- Turning it off restored `SleepDisabled 0` within about a second without any
  prompt; the watcher exited, the flag directory was empty and the row showed
  **Off**. Stopping the instance ended its `caffeinate` child.

## Lid awake per gateway run and top notice (2026-09-29, commit 53c7f3c)

From Settings → Gateway on fresh isolated instances, with the operator present:

- A new gateway started with the lid switch off, no HUI `osascript` prompt and
  no top notice; `SleepDisabled` stayed `0`.
- Turning the switch on opened the macOS dialog; after approval `SleepDisabled`
  was `1`, a root watcher ran and the top notice "This Mac won't sleep with the
  lid closed." appeared with **Turn off** and a dismiss button, on desktop
  (1440×900) and mobile (390×844), in Settings and on Home, and again after a
  page reload.
- Dismiss hid the notice, kept it hidden across later status polls and moved
  focus to the composer; a reload showed it again while still on.
- **Turn off** in the notice restored `SleepDisabled 0` at once without a
  prompt; the watcher exited, the flag directory emptied, the notice left and
  focus moved to the composer.
- On again (approved), then stopping the instance restored `SleepDisabled 0`
  about a second later; the watcher and `caffeinate` exited. The next fresh
  start again began off with no prompt and no notice.
- Two unanswered dialogs closed after about 30 seconds and were reported as
  "Administrator approval was cancelled or timed out." with the switch off.
- Console: only Lit development-mode warnings.

## Proof limits

Not exercised against real `pmset`: a gateway crash, reboot leftovers, a
withdrawn prompt and a quick restart. Those are covered by
`server/power.test.ts`, which runs the real root watcher script through fake
`osascript`/`pmset` executables. Whether killing `osascript` also closes macOS's
dialog is unverified. Off macOS, `GET /__hui/power` returns `null`, so the
section and notice are absent (covered by `server/power-routes.test.ts` and
`src/views/settings-gateway.test.ts`).
