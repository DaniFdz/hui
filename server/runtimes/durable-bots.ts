/**
 * Bots in Pi Durable (HUI-18): the document that marks a conversation as a
 * bot's chat and holds what the operator turned off in it, the `bots` and
 * `soul` prompt sections and the `message_bot`, `write_soul` and `set_profile`
 * tools only those chats get. A bot's access tools and section
 * (`request_access`, `load_skill`, `bot_access`) live in
 * `durable-bot-access.ts` and join the same extensions.
 *
 * The sections' extension is in every gateway's default selection and renders
 * nothing without the conversation's `hui.bot` document. The tools live in an
 * extension of their own that only a bot's chat selects
 * (`DurableSession.applyTools`), and refuse anywhere else; every other
 * conversation's tools, prompt and stored agent stay exactly as they were.
 *
 * `soul` is the bot's persona: its SOUL.md, read on every request from the
 * disk of the host the conversation runs on, in the bot's home folder that host
 * resolves (`BotSoulHost`). Without SOUL.md the section is the first
 * conversation instead, in which the bot asks the operator what they expect
 * and writes SOUL.md itself with `write_soul`, through the same resolver: a
 * bot needs no file tools for its own soul. SOUL.md steers every later turn,
 * so only the operator's turns (and HUI's kickoff) may rewrite it, as with its
 * name: never a turn that took a message from a routine, a trigger or another
 * bot, the one that started it or any since, which the host running the
 * conversation reads from its live chat.
