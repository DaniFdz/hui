/**
 * A bot's own routines (HUI-18; SPEC.md, "Schedules are a CLI, and bots schedule their own routines"): the
 * `routines` tool lists, adds, changes and removes the Automation tasks aimed at the bot's own chat, temporary ones
 * included. It lives in the `hui-bots-tools` extension beside `write_soul`, `set_profile` and `request_access`, so
 * only bots' chats are offered it, and it reaches the gateway through HUI's agent-tool bridge as the chat's session,
 * from a worker's host too: the gateway (`server/bot-routines.ts`) owns every rule. Unlike a bot's own tools, the
 * operator can turn it off in the Tools tab ("Manage its own routines", on by default, not powerful).
