/**
 * Bots (HUI-18): create, edit, archive, delete and talk to them.
 *
 * A bot's chat is an ordinary Durable session registered through New
 * Session's code path, and its record carries `bot`; the bot registry
 * (`bots.ts`) owns the rest. Durable, OptChat and SOUL.md arrive through
 * injected ports, so the lifecycle is tested without a harness and a bot that
 * runs elsewhere can route them: `BotConversations` (the conversation and its
 * directory; `bot-conversations.ts`), `BotMemory` (OptChat; `bot-memory.ts`)
 * and `BotSouls` (SOUL.md in the bot's home folder; `bot-souls.ts`).
 *
 * A bot's persona is its SOUL.md. A bot created without one speaks first: HUI
 * starts its first turn with a kickoff message, and the chat's `soul` section
 * has it ask the operator what they expect and write SOUL.md itself.
 *
 * Delivery follows the composer: a prompt while the chat is idle, a follow-up
 * while it works. A waiting caller resolves when the run that answers its
 * message settles, which for a follow-up is the run HUI starts once it drains
 * that message from its queue.
 *
 * A bot created on a remote worker keeps its conversation and memory in that
 * worker's Durable store, where its chat runs as a remote session: the same two
 * ports, reached through `BotWorkers` (`bot-remote.ts`), for each bot by its
 * worker. Model checks and defaults stay with the gateway. A bot list never
 * waits on a worker: its memory status comes from what the worker last
 * reported, its newest message from the live chat or one read per connection.
