/**
 * The remote worker host. One long-lived daemon per remote user runs HUI's own
 * runtime adapters (Pi Durable in-process, PI's SDK worker as a child), so a
 * conversation keeps going while no gateway is attached (a laptop asleep, a
 * gateway restart, a dropped SSH connection).
 *
 * Gateways reach it through a Unix socket that `main.ts connect` bridges to
 * the stdio of whatever command reached this machine, and drive each session
 * through the generic RuntimeSession contract (`session.*` frames). Sessions
 * are keyed by HUI session id; reopening a key reattaches to the running one,
 * whose pending questions travel in its state. Credentials and HUI agent
 * tools are served by whichever gateway is connected; credentials are kept in
 * memory until they expire, and literal models.json header values until the
 * host stops, never on disk. The one secret written here is the answer to a
 * session's `secret_request`, in a private file its agent reads (SecretFiles).
 * A bot whose chat runs here keeps its conversation and memory in this host's
 * store (`host-bots.ts`); its `bots` prompt section comes from the connected
 * gateway, which owns the roster.
