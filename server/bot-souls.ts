/**
 * SOUL.md on this gateway (HUI-18): each bot's persona, in the home folder HUI
 * keeps for every bot, `BOTS_DIR/<id>` (owner-only; also the working directory
 * of a bot created without one). A bot with a working directory of its own
 * still has this folder, so SOUL.md never lands in a directory the operator
 * chose. The bot writes SOUL.md itself in its first conversation, with its
 * `write_soul` tool; the operator replaces it through `PUT /__hui/bots/:id/soul`.
 * Its chat reads it on every request (`renderSoulSection` in
 * `runtimes/durable-bots.ts`); both writers go through `writeSoulFile`.
 *
 * This is the local implementation of the `BotSouls` port: a bot running
 * elsewhere routes the same calls to the host that runs its chat. Deleting a
 * bot removes this folder with everything in it, never following a link out of
 * HUI's bots directory.
